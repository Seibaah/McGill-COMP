#!bin/bash
touch weights.txt
for file in ./*dat; do
        while read -r data; do
                x=$data
                y=$( echo "$x" | cut -d'k' -f1)
                echo -e " $y" >> weights.txt
        done < "$file"
done
sort -n weights.txt
rm weights.txt

What this script does is create a temp file to store the weights and then through a loop it'll read every line in each .dat file.
We store said line in a variable that we then cut at the 'k' to only keep the number. We write the number in the temporary file we 
created earlier. After reading every file we sort the weights in the file and display them. We end up eliminating the temporary file.

#!/bin/bash
touch lengths.txt
for file in ./*dat; do
        while read -r data; do
                touch temp.txt
                x=$data
                echo "$x" >> temp.txt
                y=$(awk '{print $2}' temp.txt)
                z=$( echo "$y" | cut -d'm' -f1)
                echo -e " $z" >> lengths.txt
                rm temp.txt
        done < "$file"
done
sort -rn lengths.txt
rm lengths.txt

Same as previous question. Created a temporary file to store the lengths. With a loop read every line in every .dat file in the directory. 
Create a 2nd temporary file, store in it the line just read. With awk we keep the 2nd field corresponding to the length in a new variable. 
Then we use cut to eliminate the 'm' character. We store the number in the length.dat file we first created and remove the 2nd temp file
created. Once we've finished reading all the files we sort our length.dat file and display the lengths. We finish by removing the length file.

i#!/bin/bash

x=$(awk -F"k" '{print $1}' elephant.dat)
y=$(awk -F"k" '{print $1}' hippopotamus.dat)
if [ $x -gt $y ]
        then
                echo 'Elephant is bigger'
        else
                if [ $x -lt $y ]
                        then
                                echo 'Hippopotamus is bigger'
                        else
                                echo 'Both are the same weight'
                fi
fi

We store in 2 variables the weights number from the elephant and hippopotamus files. We use swk to remove all the characters after the
number(i.e kg ___m). Using an if structure we compare the weights and display accordingly which weights more.

1.4)
#!/bin/bash

x=$(awk -F"k" '{print $1}' crocodile.dat)
let "y=x"
let "x=x+2"
chmod g+r crocodile.dat
sed  "s/$y/$x/g" crocodile.dat >crocodiles.dat
mv crocodiles.dat crocodile.dat

We use awk to get the number represeentation of the crocodile's weight, (cutting kg ___m). We store this is a variable. We make a copy of 
said variable. We add 2 to the original variable. Use chmod to change permissions on the file (in case writing permissions aren't enabled). 
We use sed to replace the original weight by the new increased weight and write the new string in a crocodiles.dat file. Using mv command
we can effectively replace the original crocodile.dat by the new modified crocodiles.dat while renaming the latter to match the original 
name.

1.5) rm -r giraffe*

Use rm command with -r (recursive) and a wildcard. The latter tells the command to remove everything that has "giraffe" written in it.
