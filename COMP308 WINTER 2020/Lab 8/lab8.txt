1)The program prints 10 times "Line # X" where X corresponds to a number from 1 to 9. Eeach print happens in a new line like a carriage return would do but without using this function. Then the program waits for a valid input. A valid input is a number from 0 to 9. If the input isn't valid nothing happens but if it is valid it proceeds to print 'n' columns where 'n' is the user input. The print output is "Column #X" where X goes from 1 to 'n'. Once done the program waits for a keyboard hit to terminate.
