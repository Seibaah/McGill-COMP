This circuit consists of 9 rising edge D Flip-flops (DFF), 9 multiplexers (MX), 2 decoders (DCD) and 1 AND gate. 

8 DFFs are used for the 8 bit register, each one connected to it's own MX. 

A clock is connected in series to all the DFFs. A 2 bit input is also connected in series to all the MXs. Each MX is wired to the data input of it's own DFF.

An i-th bit register MX has 4 possible inputs. The 0-input is wired to the current bit in the register of the same position. Like overwriting with
the current data; an alternative would've been leaving it unconnected. In both cases the data keeps the same values. 1-input is wired to the 
value of the register in the i+1 (shift right); for the edge case A7 the wire is connected to the input bit. 2-input in thx MX is the opposite (shift left). 
The wire runs to the value of the register in the i-1 position. The edge case occurs in A0, where the wire runs to the input bit.
Case 3 is a circular shift to the right. With the exception of A7, which is wired to A0, the other bits are wired just like 1-input (take the value from the bit to their left). 

On the left we have an extra DFF and MX. This serves to store the output bit. When we shift L or R we kick out a bit. This is stored here. This MX is wired to A7 & A0
and depending on the operation input it'll store the kicked out bit from either corresponding edge.

Underneath, we find a DCD. This one serves to direct b_in. It's also wired to the 2 bit operation line and depending on it it will decide where the input needs to fill in.

Finally, on the right we have another DCD and the AND gate. This only takes the kicked bit when shifting right circularly and sends it back to A7. The decoder only enables
this when the 2 bit signal is 1-1.
